## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

All social media platforms need to monitor the sentiment of the discussions going on inside their platform. Sentiment analysis is a part of natural language processing. In this project, I have tried to analyze the sentiment of twitter discussions. I have tried to analyze whether these tweets are positive, negative or neutral. The base dataset file was collected from Kaggle.

The python notebook file contains all the codes with necessary details at every step about the analysis.

**Used Libraries-**  Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK
